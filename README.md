### Comments

Fun project, loved it

1) What would you do to make the program better had you more time? 
Use new concurrency package classes, add comments, put classes in their own java files rather than one.

2) How would you prove that your solution is correct? 
Good question..other than seeing the results, don't know what you are looking for or if there is a mathematical way to prove it
